My name is Jimmy Tingle and that is my real name and I was born right here in Cambridge Massachusetts. I am an unlikely choice to give a commencement address at Harvard because quite frankly my friend, I am not a scholar, which will become increasingly more evident as I proceed. I am a comedian by profession, and I started to perform in here in the early 1980s, actually I did strip performing right down here in Harvard Square.

My father owned and drove taxi cabs, here in Harvard Square, he will pick up Harvard professors, they would tell them things, he would come home and tell us. For generations, Harvard has given scholarships to students from Cambridge and students from all over the world who could meet the academic requirements. Starting from the third grade, my dear sweet mother who was here this morning would say to me: “Jimmy, if you study really hard, some day you could go to Harvard.” By the sixth grade, she stopped telling me that.

Other college campuses in the 1960s were bitterly divided between the students and the administration over civil rights and the war in Vietnam. But here in Harvard, my friends and I were able to unite: students, faculty and law enforcement. It was in this very yard that I had my first spiritual awakening. As I was running I started to pray, please God, please God, don’t let me get caught. I will never do it again. My mother will kill me. She always wanted me to go to Harvard; this isn’t what she meant. And then I realized I was an altar boy.

My advice to you today is simply this: “Ask for guidance before you commit the crime”. Trust me; it is much less embarrassing to ask for help privately than to beg for forgiveness at graduation. And I am so grateful; I am so grateful that the petty crimes of my youth were not successful, for had my dishonest behavior been rewarded, I may not be with you here today.
